Please note that in some cases the download is only an overview and that further info may be available with further API calls or visits to the links contained in the meta data. If your city is missing, please add it!\r\n\r\n## Govdata.de\r\n[JSON, gzipped](https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dump/govdata.de-daily.json.gz)\r\n\r\nN.B. There is actually an API call to get all the meta data, but after a delay, it generates an error. The file is a dump that is [generated daily](https://www.govdata.de/daten/-/details/govdata-metadatenkatalog).\r\n\r\n## Berlin\r\n[XML (RSS)](daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/rss.xml)\r\nN.B. The info is very limited. A script that visits each page and scrapes the files offered is available [here](). It would be great to extend this to grab all the metadata.\r\n\r\n## Bonn\r\n[JSON](http://opendata.bonn.de/api/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources)\r\n\r\n## Bremen\r\n[JSON](http://daten.bremen.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=export_daten_json_d)\r\n\r\n## KÃ¶ln\r\n[JSON](http://offenedaten-koeln.de/api/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources)\r\n\r\n## Moers\r\nhttp://www.moers.de/C1257221003C7526/html/063BA200D9B9F899C1257B2D003292FE?opendocument&c1=1000\r\n\r\nN.B. This is only a link to a search result that conveniently lists all data sets. A script that visits each page and scrapes the files offered is available [here]().

More data is available by using the API for each data set.
